# Your goal is to go through this funky code and understanmd what it is that it is doing, 
# and how it is doing it.
# Once you understand how itis encrypting a user's file, werite a program (decrypt2.py) 
# that decrpyts encrypted2.txt.  

# This is the ransomware program that encrypts a specified file.  
# Make sure you spend time to understand how it works.  
# Feel free to change the input file to get a snesne of the programs capabilities.  
# The given input program is an example .txt file, with several made up passwords.
